# Fediverse Emoji Metadata Generator

This is a script that generates metadata files for emoji packs so that they can be used in various Fediverse server software.
Currently supported software are:
- [Pleroma](https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma) and forks such as [Akkoma](https://akkoma.dev/AkkomaGang/akkoma/) (`pack.json`)
- [Misskey](https://misskey-hub.net/en/) and forks such as [Sharkey](https://activitypub.software/TransFem-org/Sharkey/) (`meta.json`)

The script also supports creating emoji pack zipfiles with the `--create-zip`/`-z` option.
