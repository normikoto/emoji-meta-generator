This is a script that generates metadata files for emoji packs so that they can be used in various Fediverse server software.
Currently supported software are:
- Pleroma/Akkoma (`pack.json`)
- Misskey and forks (`meta.json`)

The script also supports creating emoji pack zipfiles with the `--create-zip`/`-z` option.
